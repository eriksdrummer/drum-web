                <h4>Learn how to play rudiments</h4>
                <p>As you will see, the 40 drum rudiments are essentially the building blocks for every drum beat, fill,
                    or pattern that you could ever play. Just as letters and words make up all the sentences on this
                    page, the drum rudiments make up all the patterns you play at on the drum set.

                    Now, you might not use all the rudiments. In fact, it is rather unlikely that you have used each and
                    every one within your everyday drumming. However, if you practice and fine-tune your ability to play
                    all 40 of the rudiments, you will unlock new and creative ways to express yourself on the drums!

                    <p><b>Single Stroke Roll</b> - The single stroke roll is the most common drum rudiment used on the
                        drum
                        set.
                        It's often played in beats, fills, and drum solos. It doesn't matter if you are new to the
                        drums, or
                        if you have been playing for years, the single stroke roll is absolutely essential.</p>

                    <p><b>Single Stroke Four</b> - The single stroke four is a simple rudiment based on the single
                        stroke roll
                        pattern. The primary difference is that instead of continous singles, the single stroke four is
                        played as groups of four notes. It's great for use within drum fills, hand-to-feet combinations,
                        and
                        simple solo patterns.</p>

                    <p><b>Single Stroke Seven</b> - The single stroke seven is less common than most rudiments, but it
                        is still
                        an
                        excellent pattern to incorporate into your drumming. It is similar to the single stroke roll,
                        but is
                        played in groups of seven strokes (as the name suggests).</p>
                    <p><b>Single Paradiddle</b> - The single
                        paradiddle
                        is an extremely popular drum rudiment that sounds great while played within drum beats, drum
                        fills,
                        and even unique drum solo patterns. It is an absolutely essential rudiment for any drummer
                        that
                        wants to expand their drumming possibilities. </p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 mb-4">
                <img src="img/rudiments_2.svg" width="100%" style="background-color: white;" />
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 mb-4">
                <p><b>Drag Ruff</b> - The drag ruff is a foundational rudiment that is required to play several more
                    advanced
                    patterns. It's fairly basic on it's own, but is still usable in a wide variety of drumming styles.
                    The drag is perfect for ghost notes within drum beats, or as a lead in for simple drum fills.</p>

                <p><b>Single Drag Tap </b>- The single drag tap expands on the drag ruff with one added "tap" stroke
                    (just as
                    the title indicates). This drum rudiment is perfect for creative drum fills, unique solo patterns,
                    or for just improving the timing and control of your drag ruffs.</p>

                <p><b>Double Drag Tap </b>- The double drag tap builds upon the pattern set out by the single drag tap.
                    Instead of one drag before the tap stroke, you simply play two. This gives the rudiment a total of
                    12 notes, making it work well for use within 12/8 or music with a triplet feel.</p>

                <p><b>Lesson 25</b> - Lesson 25 is an interesting rudiment because the title doesn't appear to have a
                    special
                    meaning. Nobody seems to know why this rudiment is called "Lesson 25". It would seem more
                    appropriate to call it "Drag Tap-Tap", or something else that is a little more relevant.</p>

                <p><b>Single Dragadiddle </b>- The single dragadiddle is a unique drum rudiment that incorporates a drag
                    stroke into a single paradiddle. This combination is sure to challenge you at the practice pad, and
                    will enable you to master two powerful abilities simultaneously.</p>

                <p><b>Dragadiddle #1</b> - There are two different varitions of the dragadiddle rudiment. This lesson
                    covers
                    the first version which is known as "dragadiddle #1" or "drag paradiddle". Later, you can learn how
                    to play the dragadiddle #2 alternate rudiment to get complete mastery of these complimentary
                    patterns.</p>

                <p><b>Dragadiddle #2</b> - This dragadiddle rudiment is a follow-up to the dragadiddle #1 pattern. It is
                    known
                    as "dragadiddle #2" or "drag paradiddle #2". Be sure you master the first version before practicing
                    this rudiment, as it can be a little more difficult to jump right into it.</p>
